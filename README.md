FocusDock

FocusDock is a Chrome extension built during a time-restricted hackathon to help people pause a task midway and return to it later without losing context.

When you’re working on something and can’t finish it in one sitting, FocusDock lets you save the page as a task, note what needs to be done, and come back to it when you’re ready.

What FocusDock Does

Save the current webpage as a to-do task

Set priority and add specific notes for the task

View tasks sorted by priority so important work comes first

Summarize the visible content of the current page into short bullet points

Extract important and commonly used words from job descriptions

Use a simple chat area to:

view your to-do list

summarize the page

extract keywords

manage tasks

control a focus timer

Start a manual focus timer (Pomodoro-style) through the chat to track work time

Switch between light and dark mode based on preference
